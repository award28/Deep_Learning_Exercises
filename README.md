# deep\_learning\_exercises
Exercises to help learn material from the 
[Deep Learning Book.](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Prerequisites

If deep learning seems interesting to you, I would checkout 
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) 
video series by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown) 
which covers neural networks. If this is something that you like to learn how to
implement on your own, this may be a good place to start.

I highly recommend you have a firm understanding of linear algebra and part 1
of the text before you continue on to the more exciting chapters. While reading 
chapter 7 (regularization) I had to stop and refresh with the 
[Khan Academy Linear Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra).

It may be useful to have multivariable calculus under your belt. I have not taken this course, but it comes up frequently throughout the Deep Learning Book. Check out the 
[Khan Academy Multivariable Calculus Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus).

## Path for Learning
The overarching objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of
deep learning.

All of the exercises that I attempt in this project will be done from scratch 
with guidance as needed from various textbooks and tutorials. Resources used to
facilitate exercises will be listed in the exercises readme. If a resource is
used more than once I will most likely put them in this readme.

There is no strict path for projects, but I will tend to follow the chapters
in the main text. Below is a rough idea of how I plan to complete this project.
All of the unfinished exercises are subject to change.
