# MNIST Multilayer Perceptron 

### Date: 6/10/18

The goal of this project is to make an MLP that can predict hand written digits
correctly. The dataset is provided [here.](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

So far I've added another hidden layer to the xor network, now both have 16 
nodes. With that, I can start working on the MNIST data set with this network.
